# Welcome to James Martinez's ePortfolio!

This ePortfolio contains a professional self-assessment, followed by a code review of several artifacts that will undergo revision and enhancements. 

Each artifact presented in this ePortfolio will also be accompanied by narratives that reflect on the revision and enhancement process.

Thank you kindly for spending your time reviewing my ePortfolio!

## Narrative 
The name of this artifact is the WetSpec, a weather reporting station that runs on the Raspberry Pi platform which is connected to a GrovePi electronics board which 
has the capability to easily connect a wide range of sensor types.  The software for this project was designed using Python.

This artifact was selected to showcase my ability to write software to interface with embedded systems to control hardware and software components, and display data from an 
embedded device by modifying interfacing software in an emerging systems architecture. The artifact was improved by including Twitter feed functionality that will tweet 
the weather data every minute to a specified Twitter account.  

Several revisions were made to the initial enhancement plan as I had originally planned to revise the code to add color-coded functionality to the temperature and humidity 
readings. However, I later decided to include the ability for the program to tweet the weather data on a specified Twitter account.  

During the enhancement process for this element of the final project I was able to see the theory of having new ideas and perspectives after not seeing a specific code for 
a period of time, play out in a real-world scenario.  The original source code for this project was done about 6 months ago and when I submitted the code for a class final project,
I was very satisfied with the result.  The program functioned exactly the way I intended and was the final product after weeks of revisions and improvements.  However, after 
many months without seeing the code I right away noticed that some of the comments were confusing to understand, and since I hadnâ€™t seen the code for months it took me a 
while to remember what the code was designed to accomplish.
