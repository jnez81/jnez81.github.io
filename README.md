## Welcome to James Martinez's ePortfolio!

The ePortfolio starts with a professional self-assessment, then followed by a code review of several artifacts that will undergo revision and 

enhancements to their functionality. 

Each artifact that is presented in this ePortfolio will also be accompanied with their respective narratives that reflect on the enhancement

process.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/jnez81/jnez81.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
